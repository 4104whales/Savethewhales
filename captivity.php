              	Tillikum
              </h3>
              <p>
                  Tillikum, the orca, killed his trainer by drowning. We don’t know why. He seems to have been fond of her and, from reports, she gave him some much-needed attention. He is the largest orca in captivity and lives in a woefully small tank unfit for even a small dolphin or porpoise. There is no tank anywhere that is large enough to provide an orca with quality of life.

Tillikum is 29 years old and the largest orca in captivity. In 1991, he was on display at Sealand of the Pacific in Canada when he and two other orcas killed a trainer in their pool by holding her under water. Tillikum did not instigate the attack started by an 8-year-old female named Haida, but he joined in. After this incident, he was sold to Sea World.

The reputation of the three SeaWorld facilities has been further tarnished as trainers continue to be injured or killed and orcas continue to live in deplorable conditions. Orcas have bumped, bitten, grabbed, dunked and held trainers on the pool bottom, in some cases leading to their death. What has been learned by the legacy of tragedy at SeaWorld and other aquaria? Nothing it appears; however, no record exists of an orca in the wild killing a human.

If Tillikum had been allowed to live a normal life, he would have enjoyed his family’s company, hunted cooperatively, and traveled up to a 100 miles a day in open water. Instead he lives in a confined situation with poor teeth and a bent-over dorsal fin, a condition that occurs in all captive male orcas and some females.

SeaWorld and other aquaria have made millions charging very high rates for people to watch imprisoned animals do tricks. The real majesty of orcas can only be seen in the wild or by learning about their lives from videos, movies and websites.

              	Lolita-a Life of Captivity
              </h3>
              <p>
                  Lolita, originally named Tokitae, is the last surviving orca of 45 members of the Southern Resident community of orcas that were captured and delivered for display in marine parks between 1965 and 1973. Thirteen of these orcas were killed in the capture process. Though she is considered a young adult, Lolita is the oldest whale in captivity and has been held at a Miami marine park since 1970. The Lolita Come Home Project’s goal is to move Lolita from her dismal living conditions at Miami Seaquarium. They want her moved to a rehabilitation and retirement facility in an ocean water sea pen in Washington State. Here, Lolita could retire from show business, while still receiving the care of humans.
The Come Home project states that socially, biologically and logistically, Lolita is capable of gradual reintroduction to her pod. www.orcanetwork.org.

              	Corky, Captive at Sea World – San Diego
              </h3>
              <p>
                  Corky, a female orca, has lived in captivity longer than any orca. For 38 years, she has been walked on, ridden on and climbed over and has performed foolish tricks in order to obtain food while living at Sea World, San Diego. Corky was captured at the age of four in the waters above Vancouver Island (the “Northern Residents”) and taken from her mother and family, the A-5 pod. This would make her age 41.

She has lived longer than any captive orca. Because orca lifespan is cut so short in captivity, aquaria instated that an orca’s lifespan was only 35 years, not its lifespan in the wild of 70 and beyond.

Originally housed at Marineland near Los Angeles, Corky and her mate Orky were transferred to Sea World, where Orky only lived for 18 months. In a freak accident, Corky was attacked by a female orca name Kandu, who was killed in the assault. Such a bizarre event has never been witnessed in orca history anywhere in the world.

                Bimbo-Pilot Whale Returned to Wild
              </h3>
              <p>
                  After almost eight years of captivity at Marineland of the Pacific, a 20-year-old pilot whale named Bimbo was successfully reintroduced to the wild. He was captured in 1960 and performed well for almost three years, but when his female pilot whale and dolphin companions died, his behavior changed drastically.

One day he would be friendly and the next he would be in a wildly agitate state, or he might be depressed. After four years of treatment, which included antidepressant drugs and tranquilizers, Bimbo smashed into a window of the aquarium, flooding spectators.
Released in August 1967, he was later sighted near Santa Barbara, CA by a U.S. Navy collector. In 1974,  he was seen near San Clemente, CA and identified from photographs.

                Keiko
              </h3>
              <p>
                  The most famous orca in the world, died on 12 December 2003, in Taknes Bay, Norway, probably from acute pneumonia.

              </p>

              <h3>
                  Keiko’s Early Years
              </h3>

              <p>Keiko was born in 1977 or ’78 in Atlantic waters near Iceland. While an infant, he was stolen from his mother’s side and in 1979 he taken to an Icelandic aquarium called Saedyrasfnid.

In 1982, he was purchased by Marineland in Ontario, Canada. Here he began training and performing for the public. His skin lesions appeared for the first time.

In 1985, Marineland sold him to Reino Aventura, an amusement park in Mexico City, for $350,000. For eight years, he lived in the amusement park in a tank that was much too small and too warm for an orca. These conditions led to his skin lesions becoming worse and his dorsal fin bending over. Bent dorsal fins are often seen in captive orcas due to the lack of exercise.

              <h3>
                Keiko’s Film Career
              </h3>

              <p>In 1992, the filming of the movie Free Willy began at Reino Aventura in Mexico City.

It was the story of a young boy who befriends a killer whale in his small tank and then coaxes him to leap over a sea wall to freedom. After stardom from Keiko’s role in the film, many negotiations ensued with his Mexican owners to improve his living conditions for Keiko and wanted his screen life of freedom to become his real life. It was a slow process for Keiko to get his freedom he moved to a different Aquarium in Oregon and then one in Iceland to rehabilitate him back into the wild.

              <h3>
                Keiko Released Into Ocean
              </h3>

              <p>In July 2002, Keiko was released into the open ocean. He was separated from his walk boat and spent several weeks in the waters of the North Atlantic. This was the longest time he had spent away from humans since his capture in 1979. He turned up in Norway, nearly 1,000 miles away. He was a hit in the village of Halsa on Norway’s west coast. So many people wanted to swim with him and even crawl on his back, that animal protection authorities had to place a ban on people approaching him.

Shortly after Keiko release he got pneumonia and it came on quickly. After he died, he was buried on a snowbound pasture. Normally a dead whale would be towed to sea and sunk in deep water. His burial was done in secret to keep the media away. During the night, machines dug a hole near the waterline, and then Keiko was slid a few yards across the snow to his grave. Hundreds of people have visited since and left mementoes on his grave.

                Ishmael-Orca Deserts United States Navy
              </h3>
              <p>
                  This is the story of a young orca who was captured in 1968 by the Seattle Aquarium near Seattle, Washington. He was named Ishmael and shipped to Point Mugu, California, to begin training with the United States Navy as part of Project Deep Ops.

His basic Navy education began on May 24, 1969. Ishmael was trained to return to his station, allow handling, respond to a recall buzzer attached to his backpack, retrieve an inflated ball with an attached ring, swim through a 10 X 10 foot gate, hold his breath and exhale on acoustic command, and follow a nine-foot outboard boat.

After basic training ended at Point Mugu in December 1969, Ishmael was transferred to Project Deep Ops in Hawaii to start his deep diving assignment.

On 19 February 1971, Ishmael made a dive to 500 feet. On the next trial, he made a shallow dive and returned to the boat. On the third try, he made another shallow dive, spat out the training device in his mouth, and returned to the boat.

When he surfaced, Ishmael slapped his large tail flukes on the water (lobtailing) and hit the water with his pectoral fins. After he swam a few hundred yards away from the boat, his trainers decided to stop his lessons for the day.

But Ishmael had a different plan. He started swimming toward the channel entrance and never looked back. He refused to respond to radio signals transmitted via his backpack. The Navy sped after him. When last sighted, Ishmael was outside the channel entrance. Despite a search for several days by boat and air, Ishmael was never seen again …at least not by the Navy.

                Wally-In Memory of Wally
              </h3>
              <p>
                  Wally was one of the marine mammal stars at Knott’s Berry Farm, Buena Park, California, over a decade ago. Since that time, Knott’s has discontinued the practice of captive dolphins, a project the Save The Whales worked on.

Wally, a 10-year-old Atlantic bottlenose dolphin, died of congestive heart failure. He was a big attraction and appeared with two other dolphins, Katie and Tai. The trio was moved to Magic Mountain while their pool was cleaned. Veterinarian Joe Alexander did not believe the move contributed to Wally’s death but stated that bottlenose dolphins usually live to their late 20s.

Deaths like Wally’s occur frequently. But the public usually doesn’t know, as the parks keep this negative news from the public. At Sea World all of the orcas are called “Shamu,” so the death of an orca may go unnoticed.

                Sharky-Another Aquarium Death

              <p>
                 A female bottlenose dolphin named Sharky died during last the week of April 2008 at Discovery Cove in Orlando, Florida, when she collided with another dolphin in a show. This is another tragic story of an animal kept in captivity.

Around the world, about 1,000 dolphins are held captive by the “entertainment” industry where they are forced to spend their abbreviated lives performing as a tourist attraction. As a tourist, you can make a choice not to attend these programs with their inherent animal cruelty.
