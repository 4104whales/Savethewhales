              <p>
                  The vaquita is listed as Critically Endangered (facing an extremely high risk of extinction in the wild) by the IUCN Red list authority, and has received a great deal of attention within the IUCN Cetacean Specialist Group, and the International Whaling Commission’s Small Cetacean Subcommittee. The vaquita has been recognized as a rare and vulnerable species since its scientific discovery fifty years ago. There are a number of potential threats facing the species (including habitat alterations by the drastic reduction of freshwater flow of the Colorado River), and its limited range in shallow waters of the upper portion of Mexico’s Gulf of California is considered to be the smallest of any marine cetacean.

              <p>
                  After commercial whaling ceased on these whales in the 1930s, the right whales have not made any significant recovery. They were called the right whale, possibly by whalers, because it was the “right” whale to kill. They were fairly easy targets, as they are slow swimmers and float when dead. A right whale is a large stocky baleen whale. They are predominantly black but there may be large splotches of white on the underside and other places on the body. Its upper and lower jaws are highly curved which allows its large baleen plates to be enclosed when the animal is swimming. A right whale has no upper (dorsal) fin. Its fins are large and more paddle-shaped than the pointed flippers of most other whales. Its flukes are very wide with a notch in the center. Its eyes are located just above the corners of the mouth. The blowholes are widely separated at the highest point of the rear part of the head and create a bushy V-shaped blow.

              <p>
                  It is not known whether the North Atlantic Right Whale can come back because of its low numbers. Habitat destruction continues to be a problem along with fishing activities and ship collisions. The whales migrate to this area every winter to birth their calves. They are on the verge of extinction, even the death of just one whale could affect the survival of the species. These Right Whales’ bodies are rotund tapering to a relatively narrow tail. The large head, with its strongly arched upper and lower jaws, is one-fourth or more of their body length. Skin color is black and brown, they lack a dorsal fin and do not ventral pleats. Their baleen is long (8 or 9 feet).

                  South Asian River Dolphin lives in the one of the world’s most densely populated areas, and is threatened by removal of river water and siltation arising from deforestation, pollution and entanglement in fisheries nets. South Asian River Dolphin has a long thin snout, rounded belly, stocky body and large flippers. The dolphin has the peculiarity of swimming on one side so that its flipper trails the muddy bottom. This behavior is understood to help it to find food.

              	5. Atlantic Humpback Dolphin (VU)
              </h3>
              <p>
                  The Atlantic Humpback Dolphin is highly vulnerable to the effects of human activities. Fisheries impact the dolphin, firstly, by causing incidental mortality when the dolphin becomes entangled in fishing gear. This is currently considered to be the greatest immediate threat to this species, and may be the reason behind the rarity of this species in the coastal waters of Senegal and Gambia, and in Dakhla Bay in Western Sahara, two areas in which the Atlantic humpbacked dolphin was once common. The most distinctive feature of this rather elusive cetacean is its distinctive humped appearance when it breaks the ocean’s surface to breathe. This is caused by the wide hump or ridge on the dolphin’s back, from which the dorsal fin emerges. The Atlantic humpback dolphin is a robust-bodied marine mammal, typically slate grey on the sides and back and light grey on the underside.

              	6. Hector’s Dolphin (EN)
              </h3>
              <p>
                  Hector’s dolphin is listed as one of the Top 10 Most-Endangered Species of Cetaceans in world of No. 6, and is designated as EN (facing a very high risk of extinction in the wild). It was named after Sir James Hector (1834-1907), the curator of the Colonial Museum in Wellington, which is now the Museum in New Zealand. Hector’s is predominantly a gray animal, but much of the face is dark gray to black. Its complex markings include a dark “collar,” which extends from the area above the eyes to behind the blowhole. The throat and most of the lower jaw, as well as the belly, are white. The black marking of the face is continuous with that of the flippers. It continues in a line on the ventrum, making a V at the midline. Part of the head starting just behind the black lower jaw tip is white, as is the area from just behind the flippers to the urogenital area. White patches also extend up the sides.

The dorsal fin is low, but relatively broad and rounded and some people say that it reminds them of Mickey Mouse ears, with the leading edge rising at a shallow angle from the back and a notch at the posterior base. Flippers are small and rounded at the tips.

              </h3>
              <p>
                  Also known as the Black Dolphin, is only found in freshwater estruaries, and coastal areas surrounding Chile. Because of their preference for shallow coastal waters, these dolphins are often threatened by local fisherman. This dolphin is popularly used in Chile as crab bait, as well as a food source for humans. The species’ population is decreasing because of this, and is now considered Near Threatened. Hunting restrictions have been stablished in Chile, however, the government has had difficulty enforcing this law in remote areas. Resembling fellow Cephalarhynchus species, Chilean dolphins are generally described as small and chunky with lengths of about 1.65 meters for both males and females. These dolphins weigh approximately 57 kilograms; females may be slightly larger than males (slight sexual dimorphism). Chilean dolphins have a tout, torpedo-like shape and can have a girth of up to two-thirds of their length. The head is conical in shape and lacks a beak and melon. However, black dolphins have a large number of teeth: 24 to 31 on each side of each jaw.

              </h3>
              <p>
                  The name “Franciscana” is of unknown origin, but one suggestion connects it to the monks of the Franciscan order, the “gray friars” who were involved in the earliest European settlement of Uruguay; the dolphin’s grayish color may be responsible for its curious name. Although it is grouped with the other freshwater species, its cervical vertebrae are unfused. It looks more “dolphin-like” than other freshwater species and is not really a freshwater inhabitant at all. This species tends to travel alone or in small groups of a few animals. It is inconspicuous at sea; its blow is hardly detectable and it does not roll or jump out of the water. The franciscana is listed as being Data Deficient in the 2004 IUCN Red list of Threatened Species. This species is of particular conservation concern because of its restricted distribution and its vulnerability to by-capture in fishing gear.

              <p>
                  A new species of dolphin was found in Australia’s northern waters in 2005. The discovery of the Australian snubfin-previously thought to be an Irrawaddy dolphin-is extremely rare, particularly when many species today are heading towards extinction. The snubfin has a rounded forehead and a very small, “snubby” dorsal fin. Like many dolphin species, they are threatened by habitat destruction and accidental entanglement in fishing gear.

              <p>
                  The Indo-Pacific hump-backed dolphin is an uncommon resident of the coastal waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans. They are usually found near shore in tropic waters. They do not bowride and do not seem attracted to boats. 

Its head somewhat resembles that of the bottlenose dolphin, although its beak is relatively long and its melon not so pronounced. There is often a think elevation or hump in the middle of the back of adults, and the small triangular dorsal fin appears to rest on this raised platform. It appears that Atlantic humpbacked dolphins and Indopacific humpbacked dolphins found approximately to the west of Indonesia have the hump, but those to the east do not. When present, the hump is very noticeable when the animal arches its back to sound. The animal is basically gray, but its coloration can differ greatly depending on its region.
