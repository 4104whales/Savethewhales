                  Save The Whales Prevents Navy “Ship Shock” Tests and Save 10,000 Marine Mammals
              </h2>
              <p>
                In an unprecedented victory, Save The Whales attorney and scientific experts stopped the U.S. Navy from detonating 269 “Ship Shock” explosives in waters off of Southern California. Countless Marine mammals were saved from death and injury including endangered whales, dolphins, and seals.

              <p>
              Save the Whales, in conjunction with Mexican and U.S. environmental groups, worked relentlessly to halt Mitsubishi’s plan to expand salt mining operations into fragile San Ignacio Lagoon, Baja California – the last underdeveloped gray whale birthing lagoon in the world.

              </h2>
              <p>
                  Taken from their families in the wild, 50% of dolphins die within 2 years and their estimated life span shrinks from 35 years to less than 5. Save The Whales continues to educate the public about the cruelty of captivity.

                   Save the Whales Works With Local, State, and Federal Agencies to Reduce Urban Runoff
              </h2>
              <p>
                  Seat otters in Monterey, California are dying from diseases believed to be caused by urban runoff. Storm water pollution (urban runoff) is one of the largest sources of water pollution nationwide. Pollutants, including used motor oil, antifreeze, detergents, litter, paint, pesticides, pet waste, and copper, are flushed off streets and into storm drains which lead straight into rivers, creeks, and the ocean. Toxic chemicals (DDT and PCB’s) in the ocean continue to affect marine mammals. Educating the public about this serous water quality issue is priority for Save The Whales.

                   Saving Whales: The Next Generation
              </h2>
              <p>
                  No one action will ensure the safety of whales for all time. This why Save The Whales devotes so much time reaching out to children about marine life. So far, over 275,000 children have learned about whales and how to save sea life through Whales on Wheels (WOWTM). This innovative hands-on program – taugt by marine biologist – brings whale bones, marine mammals artifacts, and conservation messages to the classroom.
