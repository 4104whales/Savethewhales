                  *New Amazing Lives of Sea Turtles 
              </h2>
              <p>
                  Explore sea turtle evolution, anatomy, and conservation, and look at one of the most remarkable and specialized marine creatures that travel throughout the world’s oceans. They have been on earth over 100 million years and now face the threat of extinction. Learn about their cology and human impacts that affect their survival like fishing practices, illegal shell trading/egg poaching, oil pollution and marine debris that has accumulated into massive garbage patches. Hands-on activities will include: Identifying the 7 unique species of sea turtles using a collection of skulls and turtles; determining feeding techniques and diet; and exploring their life cycle and survival threats. A selected student will wear a Leatherback Sea Turtle costume to demonstrate adaptation (for lower grade levels). Find out how you can help Save The Sea Turtles! Grades 3 and Up

              </h2>
              <p>
                  Learn how species are linked and dependent upon each other within their ecosystems, and the importance of saving biodiversity. Hands-on activities will further explore the value of sanctuaries, parks, and reserves (Marine Protected Areas) as tools for conserving marine life. Touch the life-sized model of a vaquita calf porpoise, the world’s most-endangered cetacean, and learn how gillnets endanger their lives. A selected student will wear a habitat costume to demonstrate how plants, fishes, animals, rocks, air, water, sun and people are all connected in the Earth’s web of life (for lower grade levels).

                  *New Whale of a Rhythm Program (WOARP)
              </h2>
              <p>
                  Journey into rhythmic world of whale and dolphin communication via multi-media, hands-on set of integrated classroom activities. Our instructor(s) will help students use drums and other percussion instruments to imitate cetacean songs and communicate with each other. Together they will discover how difficult communication becomes when mingled with noises made by ships and other man-made sounds. Students will learn grade-appropriate basic of whale and dolphin communication and the importance of conserving cetaceans and their habitats. Grades 2 and Up
