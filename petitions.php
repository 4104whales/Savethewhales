                  Only 97 vaquita porpoise are left in the world. They face extinction if immediate action
                  isn’t taken. We need 50,000 signatures. The vaquita population lives ONLY in the
                  northern waters of the sea of Cortez, Mexico. Improvement to was being made by
                  Mexico to protect the vaquita with compensation to fishermen who switched to trawl
                  nets and the establishment of a vaquita refuge. But this is still not enough for helping
                  these beautiful creates please help.

                  Seismic airgun activity for oil and gas exploration has been approved by the Obama
                  Administration. At present, the Department of Interior is deciding whether to allow
                  seismic surveys for offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean from New Jersey to Florida.
                  The proposed surveys would employ loud and continuous sound blasts that would
                  cause devastating impacts to whales, dolphins, sea turtles, fishes and other marine
                  life, as well as the ecosystem. We only need 10,000 signatures to support our cause
                  please join the cause and sign.

                  Polar bears could lose twothirds
                  of their population by the end of the century. Due to
                  climate change, the distance they need to swim from shore to sea ice in open water
                  leads to death by drowning. In addition to the dangers cause by pollution and loss of
                  habitat, there is another threat. We need 2,500 signatures please help the Polar
                  Bears!
