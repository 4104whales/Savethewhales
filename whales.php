                                “Cetaceans” is a collective term that includes the aquatic mammals, whales, dolphins
                                and porpoises. There are two types of cetaceans: those with teeth and those with
                                baleen. The order Cetaceans is divided is into three subgroups which are as follow:

                                <ol>

                                    	Odontaceti or “toothed whales,” including 65 or more living species of dolphins,
                                        porpoises and whales (sperm whales, belugas, narwhals and beaked whales).
                                        All of these species have teeth
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        The Mysticeti or “mustached whales” includes ten living species of baleen
                                        whales including the magnificent blue whale the
                                        largest animal on earth at
                                        100 feet – fin, humpback, right, minke and gray whale’s mouth. Baleen is made
                                        of keratin, a material similar to human fingernails and resembles the frayed
                                        teeth of a comb. The outer edge of baleen is smooth, while the inner edge is
                                        bristly to hair like in structure. This unique structure allows the whales to act as
                                        giant filter feeders. When the whale gulps a mouthful of seawater, the baleen
                                        traps small ocean crustaceans. The whale then closes its mouth and spits out
                                        the excess water, leaving filtered food of small animals stuck in the baleen.
                                        Using its large tongue, the whale then scoops off food from the inside of its
                                        mouth and swallows it.

                                <br>
                                As humans, we can only marvel at the champion swimming and diving capabilities of
                                whales and dolphins. Physiological and anatomical features enable cetaceans to dive
                                for extended lengths of time. Compared to nondiving mammals, cetaceans have a
                                greater ability to transport oxygen across lung membranes, and a higher percentage
                                of oxygen carrying cells in their blood. During prolonged dives, in order to conserve
                                oxygen, their heart rate and peripheral blood flow is reduced. Their muscles contain
                                myoglobin, a substance which combines with oxygen, allowing it to be stored in
                                muscles. When crushing water pressure becomes a factor, alveoli collapse at about
                                100m, preventing nitrogen absorption into the blood which makes them immune to the
                                “bends.”

                            	Hearing is integral to the life of whale, dolphins, and porpoises. There are almost as
                                many different kinds of sounds as there are species. Generally speaking, the large
                                whales make lower sounds, and the small whales and dolphins make high sounds.
                                Blue whales and fin whales emit very low frequency sounds, often below the
                                threshold of human hearing, called infrasonic sounds. The infrasonic sounds
                                produced by the fin whale have been recorded at a distance of 3,000 miles, detectible
                                with special instruments.

                            	Cetaceans are able to regulate their body temperature through the following
                                mechanisms. A blubber layer in which blood supply is minimal reduces the chances of
                                heat loss at their body’s surface. A countercurrent
                                system is a circulatory adjustment
                                to limit loss of heat. Veins found in the body’s periphery are surrounded by arteries,
                                thereby ensuring that heat given up by blood traveling from the warmer body core is
                                partially reclaimed by nearby inflowing blood. Decreased respiration rates ensure
                                warm body air is given up less frequently than ladingdwelling
                                mammals. An increased metabolic rate and a low ratio of body surface to volume is heat conserving
                                due to elimination of hind limbs and a reduction of forelimbs.

                            </h3>
                            <p class="accSub">
								Along the coast of British Columbia, there are three different types of orcas (killer
                                whales). While they are all considered the same species, each group behaves
                                differently. Best known are the Northern resident orcas who are fairly predictable
                                and therefore the most thoroughly researched. Residents have been photo
                                documented, identified and researched extensively over the past 25 years. During the
                                summer, they are regularly seen throughout the small islands off Vancouver Island.
                                The second group is named Transients because you never know when or where
                                these orcas might turn up. Because I work in the winter when transients are often
                                here, I have studied this elusive population. Offshore orcas were just recently
                                discovered and so the least is known about them. As their name implies, they live in
                                the open waters of the Pacific Ocean which makes them difficult to locate and follow.
                                <br>
                                I have never seen an “offshore” orca, but I have worked with the northern resident
                                and transient orcas for 14 years in and around Johnstone strait on the northeastern
                                edge of Vancouver Island. Out of a total population of 450 orcas ranging from
                                Washington state to southeast Alaska, the majority are residents.
                                I have observed that resident and transient orcas exhibit many traits that are nearly
                                opposite in nature.

                                Interestingly, the orcas recognize their differences and do not seek out each other’s
                                company. Orcas are very social creatures and seem to enjoy the company of friends
                                and relatives. Orca families stay together for life and consist of mothers,
                                grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins and siblings. However, on occasions when I
                                have seen residents and transients meet, they go out of their way to avoid each other.
                                Generally, the residents don’t seem to know that transients are near them, because
                                the transients are quiet. In cases where transients are close to residents, transients
                                sometimes choose to turn around and depart or “sneak” silently by.

                                Both kinds of orcas engage in boisterous play behavior when they are in large mixed
                                pod (family) groups, apparently enjoying themselves. So, why don’t these two groups
                                mingle? Genetically, it would seem in their best interest to interbreed. However,
                                because they look slightly different, we believe they are maintaining themselves as
                                two separate populations.

                                Individual orcas are identified by the two parts of their bodies that are most prominent
                                when they surface to breathe: The dorsal fin and the grey marking just behind called
                                the saddle patch. The dorsal fin of transients is generally more pointed than those of
                                residents, although there are exceptions. None of the transients have what is called
                                an open saddle. A saddle is the grey patch behind their dorsal fin. An open saddle
                                has a black swirl entering from the top. In addition, transient saddles tend to extend
                                further forward, pas the midpoint of the base of the dorsal fin. These physical
                                differences tell us that transients and residents have probably not bred in a long time.
                                The existences of residents and transients is one of the many killer whale mysteries.

                                Research on Gray Whale Migration:
                            </h3>

                            	Each year, gray whales travel some 12,000 miles round trip between their summer
                                feeding areas in the Arctic and their winder breeding and birthing grounds in the
                                lagoons of Baja, California. Typically, the migration is within five miles of the mainland
                                coast of North America. However, as gray whales enter Southern California waters, a
                                significant portion of the population choose offshore routes throughout the Channel
                                Islands instead of a costal route along the mainland shore.

                                Save The Whales and other concerned groups have provided research grants to help
                                define these offshore migration pathways and to determine any changes in these
                                pathways over time. This information is important for effective conservation
                                management of areas where gray whales do travel. Two principal research efforts
                                have taken place.

                                Through the Southern California Area Migration Project (SCAMP), a nonprofit
                                scientific cooperative, observers have been placed on seven of the eight Channel
                                Islands to record daily counts of migrating gray whales. This research, which has
                                been ongoing for seven years, has allowed scientist to estimate the actual number of
                                off shore migrators passing within sight of key offshore observation posts.

                                In addition, Southwest Research Associates (SRA), a SCAMP participant under
                                contract to U.S. Navy, has flown over Southern California waters for three years
                                counting gray whales around and in between the Channel Islands. With these data,
                                the actual migration pathways throughout the Southern California Bight have been
                                defined.

                                To date, these research efforts have produced some conclusions, First, we have
                                confirmed that many gray whales do travel offshore in the Southern California Bight,
                                Second, the actual southbound migration pathways and the relative abundance of
                                gray whales traveling each pathway have been defined. Third, both the islandbased
                                and the airborne data confirm a large offshore increase in the migrating southbound
                                population during the 1989/90 migration. This migration shift occurred during a
                                reverse El Nino and was not permanent.

                                When one does research, more questions are raised than answered. We still do not
                                know what factors caused the offshore shift during the 1989/90 southbound migration.
                                In addition, we have limited knowledge about the more important northbound
                                migration whey gray whale mothers are guiding their calves’ north against the
                                predominant California current. Research is continuing on these question
                                However, with the help of Save The Whales, we have archieved some new basic
                                knowledge about gray whale offshore migration patterns in the Southern California
                                Bight.

                                    Vessels should not be operated at speeds faster than a whale or group of whales
                                    while paralleling them within 100 yards.

                                    In general, the normal behavior should not be interrupted. To interrupt whales’ normal
                                     activities constitutes harassment and is against the law.
